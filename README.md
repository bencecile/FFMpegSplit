# FFMPEG Split
This was a project that allowed me to split up any music file that was comprised of multiple
tracks. This was done by leveraging the power of FFMpeg.

I came up with a file format that would allow me to get the correct timing of each track,
as well as the title and artist of the song.

youtube-dl was used to get the compilation music files from YouTube.
